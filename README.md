# Obsidian Daily Notes & GTD System

A comprehensive Node.js toolkit that integrates Google Calendar events, Apple Reminders, and Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology to create an organized daily workflow in Obsidian.

## Architecture

This system follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability. The codebase uses a hybrid approach with JavaScript for the main application logic and Python for utility scripts (link fixing, switchboard organization). This allows leveraging the strengths of each language - Node.js for Google Calendar API integration and real-time processing, Python for file manipulation and batch operations.

See [INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design and [GTD_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](GTD_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) for the complete GTD implementation guide.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned features, improvements, and sync strategy including private folders and team collaboration.

## Core Features

### Daily Notes Generation
- Fetches and formats Google Calendar events into daily notes
- Parses meeting details (Google Meet, Zoom links, locations)
- Creates markdown-formatted notes with navigation links
- Automatically links attendees to person pages
- Injects per-person agenda items from Apple Reminders

### GTD Processing System
- Full GTD implementation with contexts and projects
- Smart parsing of tags and priorities from reminder titles
- Generates organized task views by context, project, and status
- Two-way sync between Obsidian and Apple Reminders
- Comprehensive dashboard with all GTD categories

### Person Page Management
- Standardized person page format with frontmatter
- Email-based linking to calendar attendees
- Automatic agenda generation for meetings
- CSV import for bulk contact creation
- Smart templates for quick person page creation

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Google Calendar API access
- macOS with Apple Reminders
- Obsidian vault configured
- Homebrew (for reminders-cli)

### Setup

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd obs-dailynotes
npm install
```

2. Install reminders-cli:
```bash
brew install keith/formulae/reminders-cli
```

3. Configure environment (.env):
```env
# Google Calendar OAuth
GCAL_TOKEN_PATH=~/.gcalendar/token.json
GCAL_CREDS_PATH=~/.gcalendar/credentials.json

# Obsidian vault path
DAILY_NOTE_PATH=/path/to/your/Obsidian/vault/journal

# Optional event filters
EVENTS_FILTER=Lunch,Focus Time
```

4. Set up Google Calendar API:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create project and enable Calendar API
   - Create OAuth2 credentials (Desktop app)
   - Download JSON to `GCAL_CREDS_PATH`

5. Copy and customize config:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

## GTD Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)
```bash
npm run gtd:morning
```
- Pulls latest from Apple Reminders
- Processes GTD tags and contexts
- Generates today's priorities
- Creates/updates GTD dashboard

### Evening Routine (5 minutes)
```bash
npm run gtd:evening
```
- Syncs completed tasks back to Reminders
- Refreshes task views
- Updates waiting-for lists

### Smart Capture Examples

Via Siri or manual entry:
```
"Email Sarah about budget #email @computer !!"
â†’ Urgent email task requiring computer

"Waiting for contract from vendor #waiting #project:acquisition"
â†’ Waiting-for item linked to project

"Call dentist #next @calls"
â†’ Next action for phone context
```

### GTD Tags Reference

**Priority Markers:**
- `!!` - Urgent (do today)
- `!` - High priority (this week)

**GTD Categories:**
- `#inbox` - Unprocessed items
- `#next` - Next actions
- `#waiting` - Waiting for someone
- `#someday` - Someday/maybe
- `#project:name` - Project-specific

**Contexts:**
- `@computer`, `@home`, `@office`, `@calls`, `@errands`, `@anywhere`, `@online`

**Email Tags:**
- `#email` - General email task
- `#email-reply` - Needs reply

## Automation

### Keyboard Maestro (macOS)

Create macros for one-click operations:

1. **Daily Update Macro** - Pull reminders and generate note:
```bash
/Users/joi/obs-dailynotes/tools/run_daily.sh
```

2. **Sync Macro** - Complete tasks and refresh:
```bash
/Users/joi/obs-dailynotes/tools/run_sync.sh
```

### Shell Scripts

The `tools/` directory contains automation scripts:
- `gtd_morning.sh` - Complete morning routine
- `gtd_evening.sh` - Evening sync and refresh
- `run_daily.sh` - Full daily note generation
- `run_sync.sh` - Sync completed tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Google Calendar Auth:**
- Delete token at `GCAL_TOKEN_PATH` and re-authenticate
- Check timezone settings in config.json

**Reminders Sync:**
- Ensure reminders-cli is in PATH (`/opt/homebrew/bin`)
- Check Apple Reminders permissions in System Settings

**Missing Events:**
- Verify `EVENTS_FILTER` in .env
- Check calendar permissions in Google

**Person Page Links:**
- Run `npm run people:index` to rebuild index
- Verify email addresses in frontmatter

## Person Pages Example

### Creating a Person Page

Create a file named `Taro Chiba.md` with this frontmatter:

```markdown
---
tags: [people]
name: Taro Chiba
aliases: [Taro, T. Chiba]
emails: [taro@example.com]
reminders:
  listName: "Taro Chiba"
---
```

### Workflow with Taro Chiba

1. **Create Apple Reminders list**: Name it "Taro Chiba" and add agenda items
2. **Generate daily note**: Run `npm run daily`
3. **Meeting with Taro appears as**:
   ```markdown
   ### Meeting with [[Taro Chiba]]
   - 14:00 - 15:00
   - Agenda for [[Taro Chiba]]:
     - [ ] Discuss project timeline
     - [ ] Review budget proposal
   ```
4. **Sync completed items**: Check boxes and run `npm run reminders:sync`

## Language Choice: JavaScript and Python

This project strategically uses both JavaScript and Python:

**JavaScript (Node.js)** for:
- Google Calendar API integration
- Real-time reminder processing
- Main application logic
- OAuth authentication flows

**Python** for:
- Batch file operations (`fix_broken_links.py`)
- Complex text processing (`organize_switchboard.py`)
- Testing infrastructure (`run_tests.py`)
- File system utilities

This hybrid approach maximizes development efficiency and maintainability. See [INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural decisions.
