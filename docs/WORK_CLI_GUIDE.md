## GTD Workflow

### Morning Routine

```bash
work morning
```

This runs:
1. Pull from Apple Reminders
2. Process GTD tags
3. Generate today's todos
4. Refresh presentations dashboard

**What gets updated:**
- `switchboard/GTD Dashboard.md` - Tasks from Reminders
- `GTD/presentations.md` - Presentations status

### Daily Note

```bash
work daily
```

Generates today's daily note with:
- Calendar events
- Meeting attendees
- Agenda items (if enabled)

### Sync Workflow

```bash
# After completing tasks in Obsidian
work sync

# Or just pull latest from Reminders
work pull
```

---

## Dashboards

### View GTD Dashboard

```bash
work dash
```

Opens: `switchboard/GTD Dashboard.md`

Shows:
- Active projects from Apple Reminders
- Tasks by context

```bash
work dash --pres
```

## Integration: Presentations + Apple Reminders

### Recommended Workflow

**For presentations with deadlines:**

```bash
# 1. Add to presentations system
work pres add "URL" --title "Q4 Board" --deadline 2025-11-15

# 2. Create reminder via Siri
"Work on Q4 board deck #presentation !!"

# 3. Both show in dashboards
# - GTD Dashboard: Shows task from Reminders
# - Presentations Dashboard: Shows presentation metadata

# 4. Work on it
work pres start pres-20251027-001

# 5. Complete both when done
# - Check off reminder in Apple Reminders app
# - work pres complete pres-20251027-001
```

### Tag Convention

Use `#presentation` tag in Apple Reminders for presentation-related tasks:

```
"Finish board slides #presentation !!"
"Review deck with team #presentation"
"Create financial charts #presentation #project:board"
```

This helps you:
- Find all presentation tasks
- Track in Apple Reminders for notifications
- Connect to presentation metadata in system

## Common Workflows

# Copy URL

# Add to system
work pres add "PASTE_URL" \
  --title "Investor Update Q4" \
  --deadline 2025-12-01 \
  --priority high \
  --notion "https://www.notion.so/investor-brief"

# Create reminder for yourself
# Via Siri: "Work on investor deck #presentation !!"

# Start working
work pres start pres-20251027-002
```

### Scenario 2: Daily Routine

work morning

# Check what's urgent
work dash --pres

# Or interactive
work
# Navigate to "View Presentations Dashboard"

# See a presentation due soon, open it
work pres open pres-20251027-001
```

## Interactive vs Direct Commands

### When to Use Interactive Mode

Use `work` or `work pres` when:
- First time using the system
- Exploring what's available
- Don't remember exact syntax
- Want guided prompts

### When to Use Direct Commands

Use `work pres add ...` when:
- Know exactly what you want
- Want to be fast
- Scripting or automating
- Copy/pasting from dashboard

### Mix and Match

```bash
# Use interactive to explore
work pres
# See "List all presentations"
# Copy ID from output

# Then use direct command
work pres start pres-20251027-001
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Access

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
alias wm='work morning'
alias wp='work pres'
alias wd='work dash'
alias wdp='work dash --pres'
```

Then:
```bash
wm              # Morning routine
wp              # Presentations menu
wd              # GTD dashboard
wdp             # Presentations dashboard
```

### Dashboard IDs

The dashboard shows presentation IDs in a format easy to copy:

```markdown
### [[Q4 Board Presentation]]
- **ID**: `pres-20251027-001`  ‚Üê Copy this
```

Just triple-click to select, copy, and paste into commands.

### Keyboard Maestro Integration

Create macros:
- `‚åò‚å•W` ‚Üí Run `work` in terminal
- `‚åò‚å•M` ‚Üí Run `work morning`
- `‚åò‚å•P` ‚Üí Run `work pres`

### Claude Code Integration

You can ask Claude Code:

```
"Add a presentation for my board deck due November 15"
"Show me my presentations"
"Complete the Q4 board presentation"
```

Claude can execute the work commands for you.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: work

Re-link:
```bash
cd ~/obs-dailynotes
npm link
```

### Commands fail

Some GTD commands might fail if underlying scripts are missing. This is OK - the presentations features work independently.

Working commands:
- ‚úÖ All `work pres` commands
- ‚úÖ `work dash --pres`
- ‚úÖ Dashboard generation

GTD commands depend on your existing setup:
- `work morning` - runs if gtd_morning.sh exists
- `work sync` - runs if gtd:sync npm script works
- `work pull` - runs if reminders pull script exists
- `work daily` - runs if index.js exists

### Can't find presentations.json

The file is created automatically on first use at:
`/Users/joi/obs-dailynotes/data/presentations.json`

## What's Next

### Phase 2: Papers Tracking

Coming soon:
```bash
work paper add ~/Downloads/paper.pdf --title "AI Research"
work paper start paper-20251027-001
work paper finish paper-20251027-001
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Integration

- Link presentations to reminders
- Unified dashboard view
- Statistics and insights

work daily                         # Generate daily note

# DASHBOARDS
work dash                          # GTD dashboard
work dash --pres                   # Presentations dashboard

# HELP
work --help                        # All commands
work pres --help                   # Presentations help
```

## Important: GTD Command Status

### Fully Functional ‚úÖ

These commands are **stable and ready to use**:

```bash
work pres <command>     # All presentations commands
work dash --pres        # Open presentations dashboard
npm run pres:refresh    # Generate presentations dashboard
```

### Experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è

These commands **may fail** if underlying GTD scripts are missing/archived:

```bash
work morning            # Depends on npm scripts that may reference archived code
work sync               # Depends on gtd:sync npm script
work pull               # Depends on reminders:pull npm script
work daily              # Depends on index.js
```

**Why experimental?**
- The GTD system was recently simplified
- Some complex scripts were moved to `_archived/old-gtd-complex/`
- npm scripts in package.json may still reference archived code
- These features are included for convenience but may need rebuilding

### What Works For Sure

**Presentations tracking** (100% functional):
- Complete workflow: add ‚Üí start ‚Üí complete ‚Üí archive
- Dashboard generation
- All metadata and linking
- Interactive and direct commands

**GTD integration** (depends on your setup):
- If underlying scripts exist and work, great!
- If they fail, presentations still work independently
- See `docs/DEPRECATED_GTD_COMMANDS.md` for details

---

## Recommendation

**Start with presentations:**
1. Use `work pres` commands (fully stable)
2. Test GTD commands (`work morning`, etc.) to see if they work
3. If GTD commands fail, just use presentations standalone
4. GTD can be rebuilt later using the same pattern as presentations

**The presentations system is production-ready and doesn't depend on GTD!**
