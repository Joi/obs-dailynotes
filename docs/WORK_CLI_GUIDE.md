## Integration: Presentations + Apple Reminders

### Recommended Workflow

**The presentations system works standalone**, but you can optionally link to Apple Reminders:

```bash
# 1. Add to presentations system
work pres add "URL" --title "Q4 Board" --deadline 2025-11-15

# 2. (Optional) Create reminder via Siri for notifications
"Work on Q4 board deck #presentation !!"

# 3. Work on it
work pres start pres-20251027-001

# 4. Complete
work pres complete pres-20251027-001 --hours 10
```

### Optional: Tag Convention for Apple Reminders

If you create reminders for presentations, use `#presentation` tag:

```
"Finish board slides #presentation !!"
"Review deck with team #presentation"
```

This helps you find presentation-related tasks in Apple Reminders.

## Common Workflows

```bash
# Get Google Slides URL (create or find existing)
# Copy URL

# Add to system
work pres add "PASTE_URL" \
  --title "Investor Update Q4" \
  --deadline 2025-12-01 \
  --priority high \
  --notion "https://www.notion.so/investor-brief"

# Create reminder for yourself
# Via Siri: "Work on investor deck #presentation !!"

# Start working
work pres start pres-20251027-002
```

### Scenario 2: Daily Routine

# Every morning
work morning

# Check what's urgent
work dash --pres

# Or interactive
work
# Navigate to "View Presentations Dashboard"

# See a presentation due soon, open it
work pres open pres-20251027-001
```

### Scenario 3: Completing Work

# Finished presentation
work pres complete pres-20251027-001 \
  --hours 12 \

## Interactive vs Direct Commands

### When to Use Interactive Mode

Use `work` or `work pres` when:
- First time using the system
- Exploring what's available
- Don't remember exact syntax
- Want guided prompts

### When to Use Direct Commands

Use `work pres add ...` when:
- Know exactly what you want
- Want to be fast
- Scripting or automating
- Copy/pasting from dashboard

### Mix and Match

```bash
# Use interactive to explore
work pres
# See "List all presentations"
# Copy ID from output

# Then use direct command
work pres start pres-20251027-001
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Access

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
alias wm='work morning'
alias wp='work pres'
alias wd='work dash'
alias wdp='work dash --pres'
```

Then:
```bash
wm              # Morning routine
wp              # Presentations menu
wd              # GTD dashboard
wdp             # Presentations dashboard
```

### Dashboard IDs

The dashboard shows presentation IDs in a format easy to copy:

```markdown
### [[Q4 Board Presentation]]
- **ID**: `pres-20251027-001`  ‚Üê Copy this
```

Just triple-click to select, copy, and paste into commands.

### Keyboard Maestro Integration

Create macros:
- `‚åò‚å•W` ‚Üí Run `work` in terminal
- `‚åò‚å•M` ‚Üí Run `work morning`
- `‚åò‚å•P` ‚Üí Run `work pres`

### Claude Code Integration

You can ask Claude Code:

```
"Add a presentation for my board deck due November 15"
"Show me my presentations"
"Complete the Q4 board presentation"
```

Claude can execute the work commands for you.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: work

Re-link:
```bash
cd ~/obs-dailynotes
npm link
```

### Commands fail

Some GTD commands might fail if underlying scripts are missing. This is OK - the presentations features work independently.

Working commands:
- ‚úÖ All `work pres` commands
- ‚úÖ `work dash --pres`
- ‚úÖ Dashboard generation

GTD commands depend on your existing setup:
- `work morning` - runs if gtd_morning.sh exists
- `work sync` - runs if gtd:sync npm script works
- `work pull` - runs if reminders pull script exists
- `work daily` - runs if index.js exists

### Can't find presentations.json

The file is created automatically on first use at:
`/Users/joi/obs-dailynotes/data/presentations.json`

## What's Next

### Phase 2: Papers Tracking

Coming soon:
```bash
work paper add ~/Downloads/paper.pdf --title "AI Research"
work paper start paper-20251027-001
work paper finish paper-20251027-001
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Integration

- Link presentations to reminders
- Unified dashboard view
- Statistics and insights

## Command Status

### Production-Ready ‚úÖ

**These commands are stable and fully functional:**

```bash
# Presentations (complete system)
work pres <command>     # All presentations commands

### Removed Features

**GTD sync commands removed** (referenced archived scripts):
- ‚ùå `work morning` - removed
- ‚ùå `work sync` - removed
- ‚ùå `work pull` - removed

These have been removed from the CLI to prevent errors. If you need GTD automation, the underlying npm scripts may still work if you call them directly, or they can be rebuilt using the presentations pattern.

See `docs/DEPRECATED_GTD_COMMANDS.md` for details on what was archived and why.
