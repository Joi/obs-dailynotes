# Simplified GTD Workflow

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Production-Ready

---

## Overview

A radically simplified GTD system that shows actual tasks (not stats) and requires minimal tagging discipline.

**Key Commands:**
```bash
work refresh      # Regenerate GTD dashboard from Apple Reminders  
work dash         # Open GTD dashboard in Obsidian
work dash --refresh  # Refresh and open
```

---

## Tag Strategy: Minimal & Effective

### Only 3 Tag Types

**Status Tags** (describes what state the task is in):
- `#someday` - Not actionable now, maybe later
- `#waiting` - Blocked, waiting on someone else
- No tag = Actionable right now

**Project Tags** (optional grouping):
- `#project:bhutan` - Group related tasks
- `#project:presentations` - Professional projects
- Only add when you see natural clusters emerging

**Priority Markers** (use sparingly):
- `!!` - Urgent (1-2% of tasks)
- `!` - Important (5% of tasks)

### What NOT to Use

‚ùå Don't use these (they add friction):
- `#inbox` - Redundant (Inbox list exists)
- `#next` - Redundant (anything without #someday is "next")
- `#email`, `#call`, `#meeting` - Too granular
- `@context` tags - Rarely useful in practice

### Example Task Titles

```
‚úÖ GOOD:
"Book dinner with Jun"
"Kojunsha Lunch Presentation üìÖ 2025/11/7"
"Read exinstitutional theory #someday"
"Email Tobias re: AI@70 #waiting"
"Finish board deck #project:presentations !!"

‚ùå BAD (over-tagged):
"Book dinner with Jun #next #call #personal"
"Email reply #email #email-reply #waiting #project:communications"
```

---

## Daily Workflow (2-5 minutes)

### Morning Scan

```bash
# 1. Refresh dashboard
work refresh

# 2. Open and review
work dash
```

**Look at:**
- **Today's Next Actions** (3-5 items) ‚Üí Pick 1-2 to do
- **This Week** ‚Üí Plan ahead
- **Inbox** (first 10) ‚Üí Anything urgent? Add a date

**Don't worry about:**
- Unassigned tasks count
- Someday/Maybe items (collapsed)
- Perfect organization

### Throughout Day

- Add tasks to Inbox via Siri (no tagging needed)
- Mark completed tasks as done in Apple Reminders
- Don't stop to organize - that's for weekly review

### Evening (Optional)

- Quick dashboard scan
- Move 1-2 Inbox items to next week if relevant

---

## Weekly Review (Sunday, 15 minutes)

### Process Inbox (10 min)

Open dashboard, look at Inbox section:

**For each task (first 20-30):**
1. **Add date** if time-sensitive ‚Üí Moves to "This Week" automatically
2. **Add #someday** if not ready ‚Üí Hides from active view
3. **Delete** if no longer relevant
4. **Add #project:name** if you notice it's part of a cluster (optional)

**Goal**: Get 10-20 items out of Inbox, don't try to process everything

### Review Next Actions (3 min)

- Scan "Today's Next Actions"
- Scan "This Week"  
- Push out dates on anything deferred
- Delete anything no longer relevant

### Check Waiting For (2 min)

- Review `#waiting` tasks
- Follow up or remove tag if unblocked
- Add notes on what you're waiting for

**Done!** Don't force perfection, just progress.

## Dashboard Structure

The new dashboard shows ACTUAL TASKS at the top:

```markdown
## üéØ Today's Next Actions (3-5 items)
‚Üí Most important items: due today, this week, or high priority

## üìã This Week (all tasks due next 7 days)
‚Üí Your weekly plan

## üì• Inbox (shows first 10 of 70)
‚Üí Needs processing during weekly review

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting For
‚Üí Blocked on others

## üí≠ Someday/Maybe (collapsed)
‚Üí Future ideas, hidden by default

## üìä Stats
‚Üí Summary at bottom (not at top)
```

### What's Different from Before

**Old Dashboard:**
- Showed counts: "108 tasks"
- Projects first (but no projects!)
- Stats-focused
- Couldn't see what to do

**New Dashboard:**
- Shows actual tasks: "Book dinner with Jun"
- Actions first (Today ‚Üí Week ‚Üí Inbox)
- Task-focused
- Clear what to do next

---

## Apple Reminders Best Practices

### Natural Organization

Your current setup is already good:
- **Inbox** - Default capture location
- **Person lists** (Daum, Mika, Mizuka) - Agenda items for people
- **Reading** - Papers to read (could integrate with papers system later)

### When to Use Lists

**Inbox**: Everything by default (Siri goes here)

**Person lists**: Tasks for/with specific people
```
"Discuss budget with Daum" ‚Üí Joi/Daum To Do list
"Follow up with Mika on project" ‚Üí Joi/Mika To Do list
```

**Specialized lists** (like "Reading"): Only if pattern emerges naturally

### How to Capture

**Via Siri** (zero friction):
```
"Remind me to book dinner with Jun"
‚Üí Goes to Inbox, appears in dashboard

"Remind me to email Tobias on November 15"
‚Üí Gets date, appears in "This Week"

"Someday read that paper Kevin sent"
‚Üí Add #someday later during weekly review
```

**In Reminders App** (for more control):
- Add task
- Optionally set date
- Optionally add tags
- Dashboard picks it up automatically

---

## Integration with Presentations

Presentations have their own tracking system. Optionally link:

```bash
# 1. Add presentation
work pres add "URL" --title "Q4 Board" --deadline 2025-11-15

# 2. (Optional) Create reminder for it
Via Siri: "Work on Q4 board deck #presentation !!"

# Both appear:
# - Presentations dashboard: Full metadata
# - GTD dashboard: The reminder task
```

Use `#presentation` tag to filter presentation-related tasks in Apple Reminders.

---

## Commands Reference

```bash
# GTD Dashboard
work refresh           # Regenerate from Apple Reminders cache
work dash              # Open GTD dashboard
work dash --refresh    # Refresh and open

# Presentations  
work dash --pres       # Open presentations dashboard
work pres list         # See all presentations

# Daily
work daily             # Generate and open daily note
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows 0 tasks

Check if reminders cache exists:
```bash
ls -la /Users/joi/switchboard/reminders/reminders_cache.json
```

If missing, the pull script may not be working. For now, dashboard works with whatever cache exists.

### Tasks not appearing

Dashboard only shows:
- Non-completed tasks
- Tasks without #someday tag (unless in Someday section)
- Tasks without #waiting tag (unless in Waiting section)

Check if task is tagged correctly in Apple Reminders.

### Want to see all tasks

The dashboard limits display to prevent overwhelm:
- Inbox: First 10 shown
- This Week: First 10 shown  
- Someday: Collapsed (click to expand)

To see everything, open Apple Reminders app directly.

## Success Metrics

### You'll know this is working when:

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Dashboard shows actual tasks
- [ ] You check it 3+ times
- [ ] You can identify next action in <10 seconds

**Month 1:**
- [ ] Weekly review becomes habit
- [ ] Inbox processes down periodically
- [ ] Dashboard is trusted source of "what's next"

**Month 3:**
- [ ] Natural tagging patterns emerge
- [ ] System feels helpful, not burdensome
- [ ] Weekly review takes <15 minutes

### Warning Signs (Evaluate if these occur)

- Dashboard not opened in 2+ weeks
- Weekly review skipped for 3+ weeks in a row
- Adding tags still feels like work
- Simpler alternative emerges (just use Calendar)

**If this happens**: Simplify further or abandon. The system should reduce friction, not add it.

---

## Philosophy

This workflow follows ruthless simplicity:

- **Show content, not stats** - See tasks, not counts
- **Dates drive priority** - Due today/week is all you need
- **Tags are optional** - Except #someday and #waiting
- **Weekly review only** - No daily processing required
- **Accept messy data** - 107 unassigned tasks is OK
- **Trust emergence** - Let patterns emerge naturally

**The dashboard works for you, not the other way around.**

---

**Next**: Use for 1 week, see if it's helpful. Adjust as needed.
