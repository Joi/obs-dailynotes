## GTD Priority Rules

- Only explicit urgency is pulled into "To Do Today":
  - Title/notes include "!!", or words like urgent/asap/critical
  - Tags include `#urgent` or `#today`
  - Due today
  - Marked `#next`
- Apple Reminders numeric priority:
  - Only high (>= 7) counts as urgent; medium/low do not auto‑promote

If Mail capture sets reminder priority=3 (medium), it will no longer auto‑promote into "To Do Today".
