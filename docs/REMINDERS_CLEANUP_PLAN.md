# Apple Reminders Cleanup Plan
## Practical Strategy for 113 Reminders

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Current State**: 113 total reminders across 32 lists
**Goal**: Make system usable, not perfect

---

## Current Situation Analysis

### The Numbers

```
Total: 113 reminders
├── Inbox: 70 (62% of all reminders!)
│   ├── Actionable: 65
│   ├── Has dates: 1 (only 1!)
│   ├── #someday: 5
│   └── #waiting: 0
│
├── Person Lists: 32 reminders across 18 people
│   ├── Kenji Kaburagi: 8
│   ├── Mei Ling: 7
│   ├── Joi/Daum: 6
│   ├── Reid Hoffman: 3 (1 #waiting)
│   ├── Pat: 3
│   └── Others: 1 each
│
└── Other: 11 (Shopping, Bhutan list, etc.)
```

### Key Insights

1. **Inbox is overloaded** - 70 items (should be <20)
2. **Almost nothing has dates** - Only 2 items have due dates total
3. **Tags barely used** - 5 #someday, 1 #waiting
4. **Person lists work well** - Natural organization
5. **System is capture-heavy, process-light** - You're good at adding, not processing

---

## Strategy: Progressive Triage (Not Big Bang)

**Don't try to fix everything at once.** Process incrementally over 4 weeks.

### Week 1: Quick Wins (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Make dashboard immediately useful

**Session 1: Date the Urgent (10 min)**

Look at first 20 Inbox items, ask: "Is this urgent?"

Add dates to anything that must happen soon:
```
"X1 Studio" → ??
"Kio gift tax" → December 31 (if tax deadline)
"900 man to Kio" → This week (if payment pending)
```

**Result**: 5-10 items move from Inbox → "This Week/Today" on dashboard

**Session 2: Tag the Someday (10 min)**

Look at next 20 Inbox items, ask: "Is this not happening anytime soon?"

Add #someday to aspirational items:
```
"Make Kimono Database" → Add #someday
"Learn X technology" → Add #someday
"Research Y topic" → Add #someday
```

**Result**: 10-15 items move from Inbox → Someday (collapsed)

**Session 3: Delete the Dead (10 min)**

Look at next 20 Inbox items, ask: "Is this still relevant?"

Delete items that are:
- No longer applicable
- Already done (but not marked)
- Duplicates
- Too vague to be useful

**Result**: 5-10 items deleted, Inbox drops to ~40-50

**After Week 1:**
- Inbox: 40-50 (down from 70)
- Today/This Week: 5-10 actionable items visible
- Someday: 20 items
- Dashboard shows clear next actions

### Week 2: Person Lists (20 minutes)

**Person lists are already well-organized!** Just review:

**For each person list** (2 min per person):
1. Are these still relevant conversations?
2. Add dates if meeting scheduled
3. Mark complete if already discussed
4. Add #waiting if blocked on them

**Focus on high-touch people:**
- Daum (6 items) - 5 min
- Mei Ling (7 items) - 5 min
- Kenji Kaburagi (8 items) - 5 min

**After Week 2:**
- Person lists cleaned up
- Meeting agendas current
- Blocked items tagged #waiting

### Week 3: Round 2 Inbox (20 minutes)

Process another batch of Inbox items:

**Session 1: Next 20 items** (10 min)
- Date the urgent
- Tag the someday
- Delete the dead

**Session 2: Find Projects** (10 min)

Look for natural clusters:
```
"Research Bhutan venues"
"Book Bhutan flights"
"Bhutan gear list"
→ All get #project:bhutan
```

**After Week 3:**
- Inbox: 20-30 items
- 2-3 projects identified
- Another 10-15 processed

### Week 4: Final Pass (15 minutes)

**Remaining Inbox items** (~20-30):

Quick scan approach:
- **Keep actionable** - Leave in Inbox if genuinely need to do
- **Date time-bound** - Add dates to anything with deadline
- **Someday aspirational** - Add #someday to ideas/learning
- **Delete unclear** - If you can't remember why it's there, delete it

**After Week 4:**
- Inbox: 10-20 items (healthy level)
- Clear next actions on dashboard
- System is usable

---

## Quick Decision Framework

For each reminder, use this 30-second decision tree:

```
Is this still relevant?
├─ No → DELETE
└─ Yes
    ↓
    Can I do this in next 2 weeks?
    ├─ No → Add #someday
    └─ Yes
        ↓
        Do I know when this needs to happen?
        ├─ Yes → Add date
        └─ No → Leave in Inbox (process next week)
```

**Don't ask:**
- "What project is this?"
- "What context?"
- "What's the perfect priority?"

**Just ask:**
- "Relevant? Actionable soon? Has deadline?"

---

## Specific Inbox Triage Sessions

### Session Plan for Week 1

**Session 1 (10 min): Items 1-20**

I'll show you the first 20 from your cache:

1. See [[Akiko Murakami]] 📅 2025/8/18
   - Already has date! ✓ Leave it

2. X1 Studio
   - **Action?** Date it, someday it, or delete?

3. Kio gift tax
   - Tax-related, probably has deadline
   - **Suggest**: Add date (Dec 31 or Apr 15?)

4. Hyper scalper distributed processing system
   - Sounds like research/idea
   - **Suggest**: #someday or delete if not pursuing

5. Share model comparison from Kai to Joe
   - **Action?**: Is this done? Delete. Still needed? Add date.

6. Inquiry Regarding Future Opportunities in Art and Technology
   - Vague - probably email to respond to
   - **Action?**: Reply this week (add date) or #someday

... (continue for 20 items)

**Don't decide now - just understand the pattern.**

### Suggested Approach

**This Sunday (Week 1, 30 min):**

1. **Open Apple Reminders app**
2. **Open dashboard side-by-side**: `work refresh && work dash`
3. **Go through Inbox list**, for each item:
   - Date urgent ones (tap → "i" → set date)
   - Add " #someday" to title for aspirational
   - Delete irrelevant (swipe left)
4. **Refresh dashboard**: `work refresh`
5. **See results**: Dashboard now shows dated items at top!

**Next 3 Sundays:**
- Repeat with next batch
- 15-20 minutes each week
- No pressure to finish everything

---

## Alternative: Batch Operations

If you want to process faster, use themes:

### Theme 1: Email/Communication (10 min)

Find all email-related tasks:
```
"Reply to X"
"Email Y about Z"
"Follow up with..."
```

**Decisions:**
- Still need to send? → Add date
- Waiting for response? → Add #waiting
- No longer relevant? → Delete

### Theme 2: People/Meetings (10 min)

Find all people-related:
```
"Talk to X about..."
"Schedule meeting with..."
"Follow up with..."
```

**Decisions:**
- Already happened? → Delete
- Need to schedule? → Add date
- Agenda item? → Move to person list

### Theme 3: Research/Learning (10 min)

Find all "Read...", "Research...", "Learn...":
```
"Read exinstitutional theory" → #someday ✓
"Research CRM options" → Date or #someday?
"Learn about..." → #someday probably
```

**Decisions:**
- Must read for work? → Add date
- Aspirational? → #someday
- No longer interested? → Delete

### Theme 4: Projects (10 min)

Find all related tasks:
```
Bhutan-related tasks → #project:bhutan
Presentation-related → Move to presentations system
Board-related → #project:board
```

## The Nuclear Option: Inbox Zero Reset

**If 70 items feels overwhelming:**

### Option A: Selective Keep

1. **Export Inbox to file** (for reference)
2. **Go through and keep only**:
   - Items with dates (only 1!)
   - Items you remember why they're there (maybe 10-20)
   - Items with clear next action
3. **Delete the rest** or move all to one "Old Inbox #someday" item

### Option B: Someday Sweep

1. **Select all Inbox items**
2. **Batch add #someday to all**
3. **Then go back and remove #someday from truly urgent** (maybe 10-20 items)
4. **Result**: Inbox shows 10-20, Someday shows 50

**This is aggressive but gets you to usable quickly.**

---

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid

### Week 1: Cherry-Pick the Important (20 min)

**Don't start from top of Inbox.** Instead:

1. **Scan all 70 for URGENT items** (5 min)
   - Anything with deadline coming up?
   - Anything you've been avoiding that matters?
   - Anything someone is waiting on?
   - **Add dates to 5-10 items**

2. **Scan for DEAD items** (5 min)
   - Anything obviously old/done/irrelevant?
   - **Delete 10-15 items**

3. **Scan for ASPIRATIONAL** (5 min)
   - "Read...", "Learn...", "Someday..."
   - **Add #someday to 10-15 items**

4. **Refresh dashboard** (1 min)
   ```bash
   work refresh && work dash
   ```

5. **Celebrate** (1 min)
   - Inbox now 30-40 instead of 70
   - Dashboard shows 5-10 actionable items
   - You can see what matters!

### Weeks 2-4: Process 10-15 per week

Now that urgent items are dated:
- **Each Sunday**: Process next 10-15 items
- Use the 30-second decision framework
- Don't overthink it

**After 4 weeks**: Inbox will be 10-20 items (healthy level)

---

## Person Lists Strategy

**Good news**: These 32 items are already well-organized!

**Keep doing what works:**
- Use person lists for meeting agendas
- Add items as you think of them
- Review before meetings
- Complete during/after meetings

**Optional enhancements:**
- Add dates if meeting is scheduled
- Link presentations to people (e.g., "Q4 Board deck" → Reid list)

**Don't change**: Person lists are working well, leave them alone!

## Your Personal Cleanup Plan

Based on your data, here's my recommendation:

### Sunday, Nov 3 (Week 1, 20 min)

**Goal**: Inbox 70 → 40-50

1. **Open Apple Reminders → Inbox**
2. **Scan for these patterns:**

**Pattern: Email/Communication**
   - "Reply Hayashi MUFG" → Date or #someday?
   - "Share model comparison" → Date this week or delete?
   - "Inquiry Regarding..." → Date or #someday?

**Pattern: Administrative**
   - "Kio gift tax" → Date (probably Dec 31)
   - "900 man to Kio" → Date or complete?
   - "Rain and WorkCo for auditors" → Date or #someday?

**Pattern: Aspirational**
   - "Read exinstitutional theory" → #someday ✓ (already tagged!)
   - "Hyper scalper distributed..." → #someday or delete?
   - "Make Kimono Database" → #someday or delete?

3. **Process 20-30 items** (30 sec each):
   - 5-10 get dates
   - 10-15 get #someday
   - 5-10 get deleted

4. **Refresh and admire**: `work refresh && work dash`

### Sunday, Nov 10 (Week 2, 15 min)

Process next 20 items + review person lists

### Sunday, Nov 17 (Week 3, 15 min)

Process next 20 items + identify 2-3 projects

### Sunday, Nov 24 (Week 4, 15 min)

Final pass on remaining Inbox items

## Quick Wins You Can Do Right Now (5 minutes)

**Immediate impact, minimal effort:**

### 1. Tag Obvious Someday Items (2 min)

These are clearly aspirational:
- "Read exinstitutional theory" → Already tagged ✓
- Anything starting with "Learn..."
- Anything starting with "Research..." (unless urgent)
- Anything starting with "Someday..."

**In Apple Reminders**:
- Search for "Learn" → Add #someday to results
- Search for "Read" → Add #someday to results
- Search for "Research" → Add #someday to results

### 2. Delete Obviously Old Items (2 min)

Look for:
- Items from >6 months ago with no date
- Items you don't remember adding
- Duplicates
- Items that are clearly done but not marked

Swipe left → Delete

### 3. Date Next Week's Work (1 min)

Anything you know needs to happen this week:
- Add date: This Friday or specific day
- They'll appear in "This Week" on dashboard

---

## Decision Guide for Specific Items

### For Email/Reply Tasks

```
"Reply to X about Y"

Ask: Did I already reply?
├─ Yes → Delete
└─ No
    ↓
    Ask: Do I need to reply?
    ├─ No → Delete
    └─ Yes
        ↓
        Ask: When?
        ├─ This week → Add date
        ├─ Someday → Add #someday
        └─ Don't know → Leave in Inbox
```

### For "Talk to X" / "Ask Y" Items

```
Ask: Do I have a meeting scheduled with them?
├─ Yes → Move to their person list + add meeting date
├─ No, but should schedule → Add "Schedule meeting with X" + date
└─ No, opportunistic → Leave in Inbox or #someday
```

### For Research/Learning Items

```
Ask: Is this for work or personal?
├─ Work + urgent → Add date
├─ Work + background → #someday
└─ Personal interest → #someday or delete
```

### For Administrative Items

```
"Kio gift tax"
"900 man to Kio"
"Figure out Terada Soko"

These usually have deadlines or are time-sensitive.

Ask: What's the actual deadline?
└─ Add that date (or best guess)
```

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't try to process all 70 items in one sitting**
- Overwhelming
- Decision fatigue
- Won't stick

❌ **Don't force project tags on everything**
- Most tasks don't need projects
- Let patterns emerge naturally
- Only tag when you see clusters

❌ **Don't aim for zero unassigned tasks**
- Perfectionism kills momentum
- 50 unassigned tasks is fine
- Process incrementally

❌ **Don't add complex tags**
- No @context tags
- No #next #inbox tags
- Just dates, #someday, #waiting

❌ **Don't delete person lists**
- They're working well
- Keep them as-is
- This is already good organization

---

## Start Right Now (5 minutes)

Want to see immediate progress?

```bash
# 1. Open Apple Reminders app
# 2. Open dashboard in browser/Obsidian
work refresh && work dash

# 3. Look at first 5 Inbox items in dashboard

# 4. In Apple Reminders, process those 5:
#    - Add date, or
#    - Add #someday, or  
#    - Delete

# 5. Refresh dashboard
work refresh

# 6. See the difference!
```

5 minutes, 5 items. That's all you need to start.

---

## Maintenance Going Forward

**Once Inbox is healthy (10-20 items):**

### Daily (Optional)
- Capture new items (Siri, Reminders app)
- Mark completed items as done
- No processing needed

### Weekly (15 min, Sunday)
- Process new Inbox items (usually 5-15 per week)
- Review Waiting For
- Scan Someday
- That's it!

### Monthly (Optional)
- Delete old Someday items
- Archive completed projects
- Clean up person lists

---

**Bottom Line**: Start small (5 items), build momentum, process weekly, accept imperfection.

The system works with messy data. 107 unassigned tasks is OK. Just show what matters.

**Next**: Sunday, process 20 items, see if dashboard becomes useful. 🎯
